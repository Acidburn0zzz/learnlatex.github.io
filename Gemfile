# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!

# Supported Jekyll version by GitHub pages:
# https://pages.github.com/versions/
#gem "jekyll", "~> 3.7.8"

# This is the default theme for new Jekyll sites. You may change this to anything you like.
