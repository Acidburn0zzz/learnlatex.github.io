      >Introduction</h3>
    <p>LaTeX can be scary for new users as it is <em>not</em> a word processor, 
    and because it is not a single program. Our aim is to help you get 
    started with LaTeX from the basics, installation, to writing code, without 
    trying to show you <em>everything</em> in one go. <a href="./mission">More on our mission &hellip;</a></p>

      >How it works</h3>
      <p>We have taken 16 of the most important things you will need to know, and made them into short <em>lessons</em> which should not take long to cover. In each lesson, we give lots of examples of what you would write. You can edit and run them in this website. <a href="./help#examples">More on examples &hellip;</a></p>

## Going further

The focused lessons here are not meant to cover everything you'll ever need to
know about LaTeX; we want to give you enough to get started and to _understand_
examples and advice elsewhere. We cover getting more information in [the last
lesson](lesson-16), but it's worth saying now that getting access to a book
about LaTeX is still the  best way to learn the details. We've given some
recommendations in the last lesson.

Finally we offer a gallery of small examples showing
a range of different subject areas not covered in this introduction,
and different LaTeX packages in those areas.
