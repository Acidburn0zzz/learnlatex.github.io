      >Introduction</h3>
    <p>LaTeX can be scary for new users as it is <em>not</em> a word processor, 
    and because it is not a single program. Our aim is to help you get 
    started with LaTeX from the basics, installation, to writing code, without 
    trying to show you <em>everything</em> in one go. <a href="./mission">More on our mission &hellip;</a></p>

      <p>We have taken 16 of the most important things you will need to know, and made them into short <em>lessons</em> which should not take long to cover. In each lesson, we give lots of examples of what you would write. You can edit and run them in this website. <a href="./help#examples">More on examples &hellip;</a></p>

## Going further

We know that people will want to know more than we can cover in 16 short lessons. To help guide you when you need more information, we have therefore included a ‘More on this topic’ page for each lesson. This extra information is there to support you when you need the detail, but should not get in your way if you do not.

We cover getting more information in [the last lesson](./lesson-16), but it is worth saying now that getting access to a book about LaTeX is still the best way to learn the details. We give some recommendations in the last lesson.
