## Journal-specific classes

Many academic journals provide LaTeX classes for submissions. These typically
set up the layout to be similar to the final journal, although that does  depend
on font usage, etc. If there is a class available, it is normally provided
directly by the editorial office, who should give appropriate detail on what
features it has.

## The `beamer` overlay syntax

Creating presentations in LaTeX does not have to use a dedicated class,
but the popularity of the `beamer` class means that it is worth having
some familiarity with the syntax it uses.
